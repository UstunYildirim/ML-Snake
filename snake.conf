# neural_network_structure is a list of pairs of positive integers
# and a letter (one of t,s,r, and i). Each pair corresponds to 
# a hidden layer. The number is the number of hidden layer inputs.
# The letter corresponds to an activation function:
# t = np.tanh
# s = sigmoid
# r = relu
# i = identity
